Add or remove keywords in Tampermonkey extension dropdown.


Tested with Tampermonkey.


### Updates:

#### Update 13/07/2021:
Script is fairly consistent, but will occasionally not run when accessing the subscriptions feed. This can be fixed by refreshing the page, but of course is not optimal. While I am aware of this bug, I don't currently see it as enough inconvenience to investigate it further or attempt to modify the script to account for it. I may reconsider this in the future.

#### v0.3
Accounted for AJAX-based page changes using [waitForKeyElements](https://gist.github.com/BrockA/2625891)


#### v0.2
(Initial upload) Fixed bug
